- Built by dwarves after the last time Ubersreik was razed
- Since the city is split by the river, the sewers partially run underneath the river
- Exits to the river can be found in the sewers
- Holes and pathways that were obviously not originally part of the sewers can be seen
- Large, vaulting chambers exist where several sewer canals meet
- Sewer areas near manholes, and pathways to river exits are in better shape. The deeper sewers are more rundown and are patrolled less often
