Players begin by doing basic Sewer Watch tasks. Soon, Klug will have them helping to run smuggler tasks. If the player is friendly towards Klug, he will properly get PCs involved with smuggler tasks and gain greater pay. If the player is unfriendly, he will force PCs to do shit work and in extreme cases put a hit out on players. Players may be asked to run a mutant smuggler task as a sewer watch “task” given by Klug.

- Klug is double timing the smugglers guild and the mutants.

Smugglers guild, under criminal mastermind The Baron, is generally hostile to the Mutant smugglers and not happy about their growing influence in the sewer crime networks. Dunkelfeucht, The Baron’s stronghold, is slowly being poisoned by warpstone, causing the people to become vulnerable to corruption and mutation.

  
Players may see a skaven scout, see skaven graffiti or meet a ratcatcher guild member while in the sewers.

- If they see a scout, they can attempt to pursue. Roll Athletics/Acrobatics test to see if they can catch up to Skaven. Might have to roll to corner skaven and if rolls go badly they will either lose the Skaven, have to fight the Skaven, or be lured into a trap by the scout

- See Skaven Graffiti, may be able to roll a lore check to see if they recognize it (Very Hard). Depending on their relationship with Wilhelm/Constance, they may give some information about the graffiti (they don’t know much, but they know that they’ve seen it before and there are two main marks throughout the sewers in that style)

- Meet rat catcher, Klug doesn’t like them. Need to flesh this out more


PCs will learn about mutant smugglers, may run tasks for them, may immediately be hostile to them, may join them, etc. The mutant footmen are warped, but they have connections with unknown powerful people.

- The mutant smugglers want to out important people as chaos worshippers to trigger a fully armed conflict between Altdorf and Ubersreik

- The mutant smugglers have allied themselves with Clan Fester. They use Clan Fester assassins and spies to further their machinations above ground, and use their warriors to help protect their claims in the underworld

- Mutants guild is looking for Brandt. They want to use him to frame one of the biggest politicians in Ubersreik
