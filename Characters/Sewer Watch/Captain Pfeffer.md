- Commands watch and sewer jacks
- Does not care about the sewer jacks

Backstory: Originally in command of the watch, she is distantly related to nobility. She can be empathetic and honorable and does want to do the right thing, but believes that it is a dishonour that she has to preside over the sewer watch. Because of this, she neglects the sewer watch as much as possible and views the members as low as dirt.
