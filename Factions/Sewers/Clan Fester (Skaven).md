- Grey Seer Rasknitt

- Allied with Tzeentch mutants

- Was losing the war against Clan Grikk until their alliance with the mutants gave them enough warpstone to empower Rasknitt. Mutants messed with sewers in ways that disadvantaged Grikk.

- Potential tension here as Fester are clans pestilens, and Tzeentch hates Nurgle. Even though Skaven donâ€™t worship nurgle, there may be disdain here
